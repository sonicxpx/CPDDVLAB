    "# Analyzing SQL Workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains examples of how to use the open APIs of the Db2 Data Management Console to run SQL scripts and use Visual Explain in to analyze SQL. You will start with single SQL statements and work up to running multiple statements against multiple databases to simulate a production workload. By measuring performance over several runs you can identify the slowest statement and the slowest database. Finally you can experiment with different indexes to see if you can improve the performance of the workload. \n",

The Db2 class takes care of creating a reusable authentication key from your login information.
